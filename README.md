# 📃 Todo List

You can make a todo list. I've created this app for an assignment in one of my courses. I got the design inspiration from [Jihye Leee on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/3384144-Hello-Dribbble).

## 🚀 Features

- **Task:** You are able to add a task with a title and a sub-heading.
- **Date:** Today's date is displayed.
- **Toast Notifications:** There is nice little react-hot-toast notifications.
- **Responsive:** App can be accessed from desktop or mobile.
- **Saved Cache:** list items are saved inside _Local Storage_.

## 🤔 Improvements

- **Light/Dark Mode:** Is always a user feature
- **Developer Experience:** Add some id's and completed properties to todo tasks
- **UX:** By clicking anywhere inside todo-task can trigger as if you clicked the checkbox

## 🏗️ Development

The operation wasn't to laborious. It was a simple task to make a small todo list app. I had to find a way to make a nice list of elements that had a title and a sub-heading as optional. To make sure the user wasn't able to spam away the add function, they at least had to make the title 3 characters long. I also included a nice UI notification to tell the user the current circumstance.
