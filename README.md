# 📃 Todo List

You can make a todo list. **Note:** when you refresh your data is not saved. I've created this app for an assignment in one of my courses. I got the design inspiration from [Jihye Leee on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/3384144-Hello-Dribbble).

## 🚀 Features

- **Task:** You are able to add a task with a title and a sub-heading.
- **Date:** Today's date is displayed.
- **Toast Notifications:** There is nice little react-hot-toast notifications.

## 🤔 Improvements

- **Saved Cache:** This would fix the refresh from deleting your tasks
- **Light/Dark Mode:** an always handy user implementation
- **Pomodoro Timer:** a nice extra tool for the app

## 🛠️ Technologies

- `Vite`
- `React`
- `TypeScript`
- `CSS`

## 🐞 Bugs

- **Not Responsive:** App is not responsive for mobile view.
